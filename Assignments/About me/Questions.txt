    QUESTIONS:

1. Inline CSS style overrides external stylesheets because they are "closer" to the element. 
Since they are in the same documents which the style-changes takes place.

2. An id is used for elements that only appear once on your website (such as the header, footer, banner, etc). 
While class is used for elements that appear multiple times on your page (such as paragraphs, headings, links, etc). Class is also more specific than ID tag

3. RGBA means "Red-green-blue-alpha". It can express all the colours as RGB can, but the alpha channel allows for control over the opacity of the colour.

4. CSS files are put in the head rather than the body for several reasons, one is that its a common practise and expected to be there. 
Another is that CSS is styling of the page, not content of it, so it shouldn't be in the body. 
And putting CSS files in the header makes it download quicker, and then you reduce the risk of losing the CSS on the page.

5. The CSS selector p.article would only style the paragraph elements in the article tag.
