      <p>
        I have very limited coding skills, I did a small course in HTML a couple
        of years ago. Which I donÂ´t recall alot from. I have recently startet
        some Python training besides lectures.
      </p>
      <p>
        My expectations for the course is to learn the basics of web-design and
        styling. To be able to make responsive and decent looking websites. I do
        look forward to working with more front-end projects!

          DNS is what translates human domain names to IP adresses so that they
          can be found and sent to a user. Every website has a unique IP address
          and the DNS makes it so we as humans dont need to remember these
          addresses, but just the domain name.

          The World Wide Web (WWW) is a part of the internet, we use the WWW for
          information exchage. And this information is facilitated throught the
          internet. So the internet is the connection, and the Web is the medium
          used.

          HTML og Hyper Text Markup Language is a language that is used for web
          page creating. It is used for structure of a page, such as paragraphs,
          sections, headings and more. HTML is not considered a programming
          language as nothing dynamic can be made with it.
