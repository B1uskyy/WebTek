To get a 3d canvas, you would need to write let context = document.getContext("webgl")

#2
context.beginpath(); // to make "place the pen" and not draw a line from wherever the pen was before
context.fillStyle = "blue" // set color
context.arc(100, 100, 50, 0, 2 * MATH.pi); // makes an arc with x,y,radius, and startradious of 0 and endradius of 2*pi to get a full circle
context.fill(); // will fill the cirle with the given color
context.stroke(); // draws the circle

const countries = ['Norway', 'Sweden', 'Denmark', 'New Zealand'];
const countriesStartingWithN = countries.filter(country => countries.startsWith("N")) ; 

/* This code will filter through the array, and will go thorugh each "country" element and apply the function .startsWith to see if 
 the array item starts with the given letter */
