        The Blacklist is an American crime thriller television series that
        premiered on NBC on September 23, 2013. The show follows Raymond "Red"
        Reddington (James Spader), a former U.S. Navy officer turned
        high-profile criminal who voluntarily surrenders to the FBI after
        eluding capture for decades. He tells the FBI that he has a list of the
        most dangerous criminals in the world which he has compiled over the
        years, and he is willing to inform on their operations in exchange for
        immunity from prosecution. Additionally, he insists on working
        exclusively with rookie FBI criminal profiler Elizabeth Keen (Megan
        Boone).
