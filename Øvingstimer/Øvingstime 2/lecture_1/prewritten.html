        The Blacklist isn't the best TV show you've ever seen--it's not edgy or
        innovative with an original storyline or remarkable cinematography. It
        doesn't have distinctive, stylish features. Into its 3rd season, The
        Blacklist survives, it thrives despite its being no Breaking Bad, or Mr.
        Robot, or Fargo, or The Knick. How is this possible? Just what is its
        appeal?

        James Spader as Red Reddington is the answer and the sole reason this
        show is so watchable. He's not only the captain of the ship, he's the
        crew and the ship as well. In short, his performance is everything that
        makes this show great and I suspect he's somehow improved the template
        like performances of his supporting actors over time. The man is just a
        joy to watch and makes an improbable character--govt spy turned
        international criminal mastermind-- delightful and believable. Every
        actor on that show ought to thank Spader for allowing them the
        opportunity to make money on a show that would have been cancelled its
        first year--perhaps mid-season--if he were not on it. It's the darndest
        thing, the difference one actor can make.
